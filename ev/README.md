## Events

Here are a few resources to get started with eventing:

- [Sme's "EA Eventing Guide"](https://feuniverse.us/t/fe8-ea-eventing-guide/7080) (FE8)
- [Arch's "Eventing for Dummies"](http://feuniverse.us/t/eventing-for-dummies/109) (FE7)
- [Zim's (unfinished?) "grand eventing wiki/chapter construction guide"](http://feuniverse.us/t/fe8-the-grand-eventing-wiki-chapter-construction-guide-wip/1594) (FE8)
- [Blazer's "Ultimate Tutorial"](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zymc1h221nnxpm9/AACZicftK6SbxlndbmYXCpiua/ToolBox?dl=0&preview=Ultimate+Tutorial.pdf) (FE7) (starting on page 142)

### How to Read the Doc

`Event Assembler/Event assembler language.txt` is a big text file listing all the defined event codes for all three games, and includes a little description for most of them.

Alternatively, if you need more details on how different event codes look like, you can simply browse the `Event Assembler/Language Raws` folder.

If you're looking for a standard definition/macro, you'll want to look at `Event Assembler/EA Standard Library` instead.
